## 🧠 Overview

* **Task 1:** Built a Decision Tree classifier using Scikit-learn to predict iris species.
* **Task 2:** Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.
* **Task 3:** Used spaCy for Named Entity Recognition and sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews.
* **Ethics Section:** Discussed potential model biases and fairness considerations.
